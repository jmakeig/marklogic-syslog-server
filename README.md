A proof of concept to write MarkLogic messages to a [MarkLogic](http://developer.marklogic.com/) database. 

## Set-up syslogd

Modify `/etc/syslog.conf` to configure syslogd to write messages to a specific UDP port, `5140`.

```
*.*									@127.0.0.1:5140
```

This says to send all facilities (first `*`) and levels (second `*`) to port `5140` on `localhost`. `514` is the standard syslog port. Make sure to separate the facility-level match patter and the host with tabs, not spaces.

**Caution:** This will send all syslog messages to port 5140. [I canâ€™t figure](https://superuser.com/questions/844050/syslogd-filter-by-sender) out a way to filter by sender, rather than just the broader facility, which is `daemon` (`3`), in the case of MarkLogic.

## Configuring the Logs database

*TODO*

## Starting the syslog server

```sh
node marklogic-syslog-server.js 
```

For now, the syslogd port (`5140`) and target database name (`Logs`) are hard-coded into the script.
